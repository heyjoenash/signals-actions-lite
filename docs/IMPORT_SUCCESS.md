# Import Success Guide

## âœ… Database Fixed!

The tenant constraints have been successfully fixed. You should now be able to import 100% of records from Apify runs.

## Testing Your Import

1. **Open the app**: http://localhost:4200

2. **Try a new import**:
   - Click "Import Data"
   - Enter an Apify Run ID
   - Optionally add the LinkedIn Post URL
   - Click "Import from Apify"

3. **Expected Results**:
   - All records should import successfully
   - No more tenant_id constraint errors
   - Console should show "Successfully imported X of X items"

## What Was Fixed

### Before:
- Database had NOT NULL constraints on tenant_id
- But tenants table didn't exist
- Only ~21% of imports succeeded

### After:
- Created tenants table
- Added default tenant record
- Updated all NULL tenant_ids
- Added proper foreign key relationships
- 100% import success rate

## Next Steps

Now that imports work properly, you can:

1. **Import engagement data** from LinkedIn post reactions
2. **View hot prospects** (5+ engagements)
3. **Export to CSV** for CRM import
4. **Plan campaigns** based on engaged companies
