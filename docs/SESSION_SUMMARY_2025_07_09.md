# Session Summary - LinkedIn Engagement Tracker
**Date**: 2025-07-09
**Status**: Active Development

## üéØ Current State
- **Architecture**: Ultra-lightweight single-file HTML/JS app with direct Supabase integration
- **Database**: Supabase with multi-tenant support (using DEFAULT_TENANT_ID)
- **Key Files**:
  - `/app/index.html` - Main application
  - `/app/config.js` - Supabase configuration
  - `/database/migrations/` - Database schema migrations

## ‚úÖ Completed Tasks
1. **Fixed Profile Photo Display**
   - Created migration script to copy `profile_image_url` to `profile_picture`
   - Added better error handling with graceful fallback
   - Added debug logging to import process
   - Created test tool: `/scripts/test-profile-photos.html`

2. **Fixed Engagement Distribution**
   - Created tool to analyze and redistribute engagements between posts
   - Script: `/scripts/fix-engagement-distribution.html`
   - Previously all 283 engagements were linked to one post

3. **Fixed Database Issues**
   - Created missing tenants table
   - Fixed tenant_id constraints
   - Migration: `/database/migrations/fix_tenant_constraints.sql`

## üîÑ In Progress Tasks
1. **Profile Enrichment Workflow**
   - Recommended actor: `lukaskrivka/linkedin-profile-scraper`
   - Need to implement batch processing with retry logic
   - Add enrichment status tracking to persons table

2. **Manual Edit Capability**
   - Add UI for editing company/title overrides
   - Database fields already exist (company_override, title_override)

3. **Full Post Analysis View**
   - Embedded LinkedIn post
   - Filtering by audience/personas
   - Top signals summary
   - Review mode for discovering new titles

## üö® Known Issues
1. **Company Data Quality**
   - Currently parsing from headline (~40% accurate)
   - Need enrichment to get accurate company data

2. **Photo URLs**
   - Some LinkedIn photo URLs may expire or have CORS issues
   - Fallback to placeholder icon implemented

3. **Engagement Counts**
   - May not match actual LinkedIn numbers
   - Import process only captures visible reactions

## üìù Technical Notes
- Using service_role key for Supabase (not anon key)
- All operations use DEFAULT_TENANT_ID = '00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001'
- Import process creates both person records AND engagement records
- Profile photos stored in `profile_picture` field (not profile_image_url)
