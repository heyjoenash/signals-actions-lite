# Profile Photo Display Fix Summary

## Issues Found

1. **Field Name Mismatch**
   - Database schema uses: `profile_picture` (persons table, column name)
   - Import code was saving to: `profile_image_url`
   - Display code was reading from: `profile_picture`
   - This mismatch meant photos were never saved correctly

2. **Multi-tenancy Considerations**
   - The app uses tenant_id filtering (DEFAULT_TENANT_ID = '00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001')
   - All queries filter by tenant_id, so data must have the correct tenant_id

3. **Image Loading Errors**
   - LinkedIn profile photos may fail to load due to:
     - CORS restrictions
     - Expired URLs
     - Private profiles
   - No error handling existed for failed image loads

## Fixes Applied

1. **Fixed Import Logic** (app/index.html, line 590)
   - Changed from `profile_image_url` to `profile_picture`
   - Now correctly saves: `profile_picture: item.profilePicture || item.photoUrl`

2. **Added Image Error Handling**
   - Profile photos now have `onerror` handlers
   - When an image fails to load, it gracefully falls back to a placeholder icon
   - Applied to both the person detail modal and engagement table views

3. **Added Debug Logging**
   - Import process now logs the structure of imported items
   - Helps identify field mapping issues in the future

4. **Created Migration Script** (database/migrations/fix_profile_photos.sql)
   - Migrates any existing data from `profile_image_url` to `profile_picture`
   - Ensures column consistency

## Testing

1. Created test-profile-photos.html for debugging
   - Shows all people with profile photos
   - Displays actual URLs for verification
   - Logs detailed debug information

## Next Steps

1. Run the migration script in Supabase:
   ```sql
   -- Run the contents of database/migrations/fix_profile_photos.sql
   ```

2. Re-import data to ensure photos are saved correctly

3. Verify photos display by:
   - Opening the app
   - Importing new LinkedIn engagement data
   - Checking the People view and engagement tables

## Import Data Structure

The Apify LinkedIn scraper provides profile photos in these fields:
- `profilePicture` - Primary field
- `photoUrl` - Fallback field

The import logic now correctly handles both fields.
